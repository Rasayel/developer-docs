# Working with webhooks

## Setup

You can setup a webhook endpoint from Rasayel's API management page.

You can only create one webhook endpoint but you can subscribe to as many events on that endpoint as you like

## How it works

When one of the events you are subscribed to gets triggered Rasayel will make a HTTP POST request to the endpoint you specified.
