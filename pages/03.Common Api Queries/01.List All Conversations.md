# Explore All Conversations with GraphQL

## Introduction to Conversation Type

To understand the available fields and options when working with conversations, refer to the [Conversation Type](/types/Conversation). This will provide you with a comprehensive list of fields that can be retrieved for each conversation node.

## Querying Conversations

To list all the conversations in your app, you can use the query below. This example focuses on extracting the `id` from each conversation, but you can use any field described in the Conversation Type, as linked above.

```graphql
query GetAllConversations($last: number, $after: string) {
  app {
    conversations(last: $last, after: $after) {
      nodes {
        id
      }

      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        hasPreviousPage
        endCursor
        startCursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can customize the query to retrieve additional information by modifying the fields according to your needs. This allows you to get the most relevant data to better understand and engage with your customers or team members.
