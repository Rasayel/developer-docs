# List All Conversations

## Type

All the fields on the [Conversation Type](/types/Conversation) are available for each node from this query

## Query

To list all the conversations in your app, you can use this query. This only extracts the `id` from each conversation, but you can use any field described on the Conversation Type, as linked above.

```graphql
query GetAllConversations($last: number, $after: string) {
  app {
    conversations(last: $last, after: $after) {
      nodes {
        id
      }

      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        hasPreviousPage
        endCursor
        startCursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```
