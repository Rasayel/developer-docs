# Retrieve a Specific Conversation with GraphQL

## Introduction to Conversation Type

To understand the available fields and options when working with conversations, refer to the [Conversation Type](/types/Conversation). This will provide you with a comprehensive list of fields that can be retrieved for each conversation node.

## Querying a Single Conversation

To fetch a single conversation in your app, you can use the query below. This example focuses on extracting the `id` from the conversation, but you can use any field described in the Conversation Type, as linked above.

```graphql
query FetchAConversation($id: ID!) {
  app {
    conversation(id: $id) {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

## What Can You Do with This Query?

By using this GraphQL query, you can retrieve a specific conversation in your app, allowing you to focus on particular interactions and gain insights into individual communication patterns. You can customize the query to retrieve additional information by modifying the fields according to your needs. This helps you better understand and engage with your customers or team members in a targeted manner.
