# Attaching a File to a Message

# Type

Uses the [Upload Information Type](/types/uploadinformation) and returns [Message Type](/types/Message)

# Mutation

This requires 3 steps.

1. Getting an upload URL.
2. Uploading file to upload URL.
3. Using the blobOrAttachmentId from step 1 to send a template with a file.

## Step 1. Getting an upload link:

You can use the mutation `attachmentUpload` to get an `uploadUrl`, `headers` and `attachmentId` in the response. Store all 3 values, you will be needing them.

```graphql
mutation UploadAttachment($filename: String!, bytesize: Int!, checksum: String!, contentType: String!) {
  attachmentUpload (input: {fileInput: {filename: $filename, byteSize: $bytesize, checksum: $checksum, contentType: $contentType}}) {
      uploadInformation {
        uploadUrl
        headers
        attachmentId
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2. Uploading the file

This step is platform dependent: you can now upload the file to the uploadUrl. Remember to pass the headers from the response in step 1.

## Step 3: Send the message

This uses the `attachmentId` we retrieved from Step 1. We pass it into the mutation's variables as the `blobOrAttachmentId`.

This exampole is using `templateProactiveMessageCreate`, creating a proactive message to a user, using a template. But the same workflow applies for [Media Message Create](/mutations/mediaMessageCreate).

This uses the `MessageProactiveTemplateCreateInput` [input type](/types/MessageProactiveTemplateCreateInput).

```graphql
mutation SendProactiveTemplateMessageWithFile(
  $input: MessageProactiveTemplateCreateInput!
) {
  templateProactiveMessageCreate(input: $input) {
    id
  }
}
```

Your `$input` could look like this in your variables

```json
{
  "input": {
    "channelId": 42,
    "receiver": "+353800000000",
    "clientMutationId": "clientMutationId",
    "messageTemplateId": 42,
    "components": [
      {
        "type": "HEADER",
        "subtype": "QUICK_REPLY",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "type": "IMAGE",
            "blobOrAttachmentId": "blobOrAttachmentId" // the value we retrieved from step 1, the attachment ID
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "conversationState": "UNANSWERED"
  }
}
```
