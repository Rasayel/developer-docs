# How to Attach a File to a Message with GraphQL

## Introduction

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of attaching a file to a message using GraphQL. This process involves two main steps and utilizes the [Attachment Type](/types/Attachment) and [Message Type](/types/Message).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Get an attachment ID

First, use the `attachmentUploadFromUrl` mutation to obtain an `attachmentId` in the response. Make sure to store this, as you'll need them later. The URL is anywhere you want to store the file yourself, this can be your own CDN, or someone else's, so long as it's publicly accessible to the internet, we'll be able to download the file.

```graphql
mutation UploadAttachment($filename: String!, $url: String!) {
  attachmentUploadFromUrl (input: { filename: $filename, url: $url }) {
    attachment {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Send the Message

This step uses the `id` from Step 1. Pass it into the mutation's variables as the `blobOrAttachmentId`. In this example, we are using `templateProactiveMessageCreate` to create a proactive message to a user using a template. The same workflow applies for [Media Message Create](/mutations/mediaMessageCreate).

This uses the `MessageProactiveTemplateCreateInput` [input type](/types/MessageProactiveTemplateCreateInput).

```graphql
mutation SendProactiveTemplateMessageWithFile(
  $input: MessageProactiveTemplateCreateInput!
) {
  templateProactiveMessageCreate(input: $input) {
    id
  }
}
```

In your variables, `$input` could look like this:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "channelId": 42,
    "receiver": "+353800000000",
    "clientMutationId": "clientMutationId",
    "messageTemplateId": 42,
    "components": [
      {
        "type": "HEADER",
        "subtype": "QUICK_REPLY",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "type": "IMAGE",
            "blobOrAttachmentId": "blobOrAttachmentId" // the value we retrieved from step 1, the attachment ID
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "conversationState": "UNANSWERED"
  }
}
```
