# GraphQL Queries

There are a number of queries that you may find yourself needing more than others.
For the vast majority, we recommend inspecting the types available to you on the [App Type](/types/App)

This list of queries is **not** exhaustive, but should help you with some common patterns.

Some things you'll need to know about before you can use these:

1. [How does GraphQL work?](https://graphql.org/learn/)
1. [Authentication](/graphql/api)
1. [Pagination](/graphql/pagination)

## Automatic documentation

The Rasayel documentation is automatically generated when our API is changed. However, this list of queries is not.

This means on a rare occasion you might find a bug with one of the queries. Feel free to reach out to support by email (support@rasayel.io) or [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/13024070488?text=Hello%20Rasayel%20team!)
