# Useful Scripts

This section contains some tutorials on how to build scripts using the Rasayel GraphQL API to perform operations.

For example, exporting the conversations from your app, updating a channel user, etc.

This list is of course non-exhaustive. If you have any requests or would like to contribute a script, please reach out to Rasayel support (support@rasayel.io) or our [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/13024070488?text=Hello%20Rasayel%20team!)

Most of these scripts are written in Ruby. If you don't have experience writing Ruby, that's fine! They're easily convertable using something like Chat GPT.

You can also for the most part, just copy and paste the script, changing very little to make it work to your advantage.

You can also use a tool like [repl.it](https://repl.it) to run the scripts directly in the browser. Just make sure to choose Ruby as your language.
