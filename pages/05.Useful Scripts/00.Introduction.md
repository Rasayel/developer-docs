# Useful Scripts

This section contains some tutorials on how to build scripts using the Rasayel GraphQL API to perform operations.

For example, exporting the conversations from your app, updating a channel user, etc.

This list is of course non-exhaustive. If you have any requests or would like to contribute a script, please reach out to Rasayel support (support@rasayel.io) or our [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/13024070488?text=Hello%20Rasayel%20team!)
