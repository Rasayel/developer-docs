# Useful Scripts

Welcome to the Useful Scripts section! Here, you'll find an assortment of tutorials on how to build various scripts using the Rasayel GraphQL API to perform a range of operations, such as exporting conversations from your app, updating a channel user, and more. Our goal is to help you streamline your workflow and make the most of Rasayel's features.

Don't worry if you're new to coding or not familiar with Ruby â€“ these scripts are designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear explanations and step-by-step guidance. You can mostly just copy and paste the code, making a few tweaks to adapt it to your needs. If you'd like to try a different programming language, tools like Chat GPT can help you convert the Ruby scripts with ease.

If you prefer not to install Ruby on your computer, you can use an online tool like [repl.it](https://repl.it) to run the scripts directly in your browser. Just make sure to select Ruby as your language when creating a new project. This is a convenient option for quickly testing out scripts without the need for a full development environment.

This list is by no means exhaustive, and we're always looking to expand it based on your needs and feedback. We encourage you to experiment and customize the scripts to better suit your specific use cases. If you have any script requests, suggestions for improvements, or would like to contribute a script, we'd love to hear from you! Reach out to Rasayel support at [support@rasayel.io](mailto:support@rasayel.io) or contact us via [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/13024070488?text=Hello%20Rasayel%20team!) with your ideas.

We hope you find these scripts helpful, and we look forward to supporting your journey in using Rasayel to its fullest potential. Happy scripting!
