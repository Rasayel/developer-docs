# Working with webhooks

## Setup

You can setup a webhook endpoint from Rasayel's API management page.

Webhooks provide you a way of receiving notifications in your own systems about events that happen in Rasayel, like new conversations, messages etc.

## How it works

When one of the events you are subscribed to gets triggered Rasayel will make a HTTP POST request to the endpoint you specified.

## Testing locally

If you don't have a production endpoint to test your webhooks with, there are a few tools out there that can help you test webhooks locally.

### webhook.site

[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) is a very simple webhook testing tool. It will allow you to send webhooks to it and inspect the payload.

**Note**: With webhook.site you will _not_ be able to use the data beyond inspecting it.

### Ngrok

[Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a local tunnelling service that allows you to point production traffic at your local server. This is excellent for testing things like webhooks.

To use Ngrok, simply type the following command:

```sh
ngrok http 3000 # repace 3000 with the port your server is running on
```

### Localtunnel

[Localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) is an open-source version of Ngrok. It behaves in the exact same manner, but has a much more generous free tier.
