Welcome to Rasayel's developer docs, where you will learn about Rasayel API and how to use it to build omnichannel integrations with your custom services.

You can start with our GraphQL API which will allow you to query information from your apps and execute actions like sending messages. Soon you will also be able to get realtime updates about incoming messages and various other events with webhooks.
