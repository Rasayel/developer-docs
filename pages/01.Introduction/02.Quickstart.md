# Rasayel GraphQL Playground

Here you can find a simple playground to try out the Rasayel GraphQL API. Any request that you would potentially make from your application, you can make here.

To authenticate with the server, simply grab your app's API key from the [API Management tab](https://app.rasayel.io), and copy the `Basic Auth` value.

Then paste it into the predefined `Authorization` header field in the playground.

Some of our APIs require that you intro the user that this action should be taken as. Add `X-On-Behalf-Of` header and provide it the with the teammate ID that this action will be taken as.
