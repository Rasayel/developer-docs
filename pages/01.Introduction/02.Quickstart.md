# Rasayel GraphQL Playground

Here you can find a simple playground to try out the Rasayel GraphQL API. Any request that you would potentially make from your application, you can make here.

To authenticate with the server, simply grab your app's API key from the [API Management tab](https://app.rasayel.io), and copy the `Basic Auth` value.

<div>
  <img src="/api_key.png" style="margin:auto;display:block;border-radius:1%" />
  <p align="center" style="margin-bottom:20px;margin-top:20px;display:block;">
  Then paste it into the predefined `Authorization` header field in the playground.
  </p>
  <img src="/authentication_headers.png" style="margin:auto;display:block;border-radius:25px;" />
</div>

Some of our APIs require that you identify the user that this action should be taken as. Add `X-On-Behalf-Of` header and provide it the with the teammate ID that this action will be taken as.
[You can read more about that here](/introduction/identifying-yourself-as-an-app-user).
