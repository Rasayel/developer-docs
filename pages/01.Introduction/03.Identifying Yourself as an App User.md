# Identifying Yourself as an App User

Some of the mutations in the Rasayel API require you to be authenticated as an App User to proceed. In this scenario, you will get an error back with the code
`APP_USER_REQUIRED`.

To fix this, simply add an `X-On-Behalf-Of` header to your request, alongside your Authorization headers.

Here you can see how it's added in the [Rasayel GraphQL API Playground](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/rasayel-public-api-on1kuq/explorer?variant=current).

Here's an example of how to do it with cURL:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <Replace this with your access token>" \
  -H "X-On-Behalf-Of: <Replace this with your admin ID>" \ # Not always required
  --data '{ "query": "{ app { conversations { nodes { id } } } }" }' \
  https://api.rasayel.io/graphql
```

## How to find your ID

You can either query the API for your team's ID values using the `appUsers` field on the [App Type](https://developers.rasayel.io/types/App)

Or you can grab your own ID from your profile page in Rasayel directly.
