# Working with a GraphQL API

Rasayel's public API is built with GraphQL. Internally, Rasayel Inbox app uses a similar API with inbox-specific stuff.

If you are not familar with GraphQL, we suggest you check out the official [GraphQL learning docs](https://graphql.org/learn/). [Apollo has also great resources and tools](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/) for working with GraphQL APIs.

## Endpoint

```sh
https://api.rasayel.io/api/graphql
```

## Authentication

You can authenticate your client by using API keys that you create from Rasayel's API management page.

API keys provide you with a value for the `Authorization` header that you should configure with your GraphQL client of choice or your HTTP request.

```sh
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <Replace this with your access token>" \
  -H "X-On-Behalf-Of: <Replace this with your admin ID>" \ # Not always required
  --data '{ "query": "{ app { conversations { nodes { id } } } }" }' \
  https://api.rasayel.io/graphql
```


Some keys can be created to be "read-only" (supports queries) while others can be created as "read-write" (supports both queries and mutations). Make sure to use the correct key access before using the API.

## Getting Started

Assuming you have your API key and a GraphQL client that can introspect the schema, you can begin using the queries and mutations available. 

Here are a few clients that you can use:

- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [GraphQL Playground](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/graphql-playground)
- [Altair](https://altair.sirmuel.design/)

### Queries

Firstly, let's begin by the listing the last 10 conversations your workspace has:

```graphql
query Contacts {
  app {
    conversations(last: 10) {
      nodes {
        id
        name
        firstName
        lastName
        displayName
        avatarUrl
        identifiers {
          sourceId
          category
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mutations

Now that you have successfully fetched a few conversations, let's reply to one of them. Make sure to change the `conversationId` value to match one of your conversations returned earlier.

```graphql
mutation TextMessageCreate {
  textMessageCreate(input: { conversationId: 1, body: "Hello from API" }) {
    message {
      id
    }
  }
}
```
