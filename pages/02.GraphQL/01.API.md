# Working with a GraphQL API

Welcome to Rasayel's public API, which is built with GraphQL. Just like the public API, the Rasayel Inbox app also uses a similar API with inbox-specific features.

If you're new to GraphQL, we recommend checking out the official [GraphQL learning docs](https://graphql.org/learn/) as a starting point. [Apollo also offers great resources and tools](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/) to help you work with GraphQL APIs.

We also have a getting started guide in the next page, [Working with GraphQL](/graphql/working-with-graphql)

## Endpoint

```sh
https://api.rasayel.io/api/graphql
```

## Authentication

To authenticate your client, you'll need to create API keys from Rasayel's API management page. These API keys provide a value for the `Authorization` header, which you should configure with your chosen GraphQL client or HTTP request.

```sh
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <Replace this with your access token>" \
  -H "X-On-Behalf-Of: <Replace this with your admin ID>" \ # Not always required
  --data '{ "query": "{ app { conversations { nodes { id } } } }" }' \
  https://api.rasayel.io/graphql
```

Some keys can be created as "read-only" (supporting queries), while others can be created as "read-write" (supporting both queries and mutations). Make sure you use the correct key access before using the API.

## Getting Started

Once you have your API key and a GraphQL client that can introspect the schema, you're ready to start using the available queries and mutations.

Here are a few popular clients you can use:

- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [GraphQL Playground](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/graphql-playground)
- [Altair](https://altair.sirmuel.design/)

### Queries

To get started, you can start by listing the last 10 conversations in your workspace:

```graphql
query Conversations {
  app {
    conversations(last: 10) {
      nodes {
        id
        name
        firstName
        lastName
        displayName
        avatarUrl
        identifiers {
          sourceId
          category
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mutations

Now that you've successfully fetched a few conversations, let's try replying to one of them. Just make sure to change the `conversationId` value to match one of the conversations returned earlier.

```graphql
mutation TextMessageCreate {
  textMessageCreate(input: { conversationId: 1, body: "Hello from API" }) {
    message {
      id
    }
  }
}
```
